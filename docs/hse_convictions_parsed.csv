The operative along with the Weighbridge Manager, was present when the firm's Approved Contractor advised that pending replacement of the safety catch the automatic override would not operate properly meaning that it was possible to open the caged side access door without the machine switching off and that extra care should be taken i.e. the machine should still be taken out of automatic mode when any manual intervention was necessary.
